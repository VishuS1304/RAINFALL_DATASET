## Introduction

Rainfall prediction plays a vital role in decision-making across industries. This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at creating a predictive model for rainfall in a specified geographical area. By leveraging historical weather data, we aim to provide accurate short-term and long-term rainfall forecasts.

## Data

The success of any machine learning project heavily relies on the quality of the data. In this project, we utilize a dataset collected from various reliable sources. The dataset includes historical weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and previous rainfall amounts. This data serves as the foundation for training and evaluating our predictive model.

## Methodology

Our approach to rainfall prediction involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming features as needed.

2. **Feature Selection/Engineering**: Identifying the most relevant features and possibly creating new features to enhance prediction accuracy.

3. **Model Selection**: Exploring various machine learning algorithms suitable for time-series prediction, such as Random Forest, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), or XGBoost.

4. **Training and Validation**: Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, training the selected models, and fine-tuning hyperparameters.

5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficients.

6. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model can be used to predict rainfall based on new input data.

## Usage

To use our rainfall prediction model:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/rainfall-prediction.git`
